JavaScript provides eight different data types which are
 1. undefined
 2. null
 3. boolean
 4. string
 5. symbol
 6. bigint
 7. number
 8. object

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number".

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive.

Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors.

The remainder operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

`var myName = "your name";`
`"your name"` is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

`var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";`

`goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
 badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"'; // Throws an error`

In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.
